# Enhancer-Promoter Time-course Analysis (EPTA)

EPTA (Enhancer-Promoter Time-course Analysis) aims to investigate the time-relationship between enhancer-promoter interactions. Using what we learn from time-courses, we hope to 1) build a model to predict enhancer-promoter connections from time-course data and 2) validate our model's predictions with experimental techniques, such as perturb-seq.

## Datasets

1.  MOMA (monocyte/macrophage differentiation data)
2.  LIMA (LPS-Induced Machrophage Activation)
3.  TBD...
